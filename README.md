ForceMate is a plugin for the awesome OSX text editor TextMate. Using the plug-in you can easily save apex code to your Salesforce.com account, run tests etc.

Big thanks to Simon Fell for contributing ApexMate, the initial code that started this all.

To get started, simply rename the plugin directory to ForceMate.plugin, then double-click it to install as a bundle
